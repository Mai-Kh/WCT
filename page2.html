Also, Junie has trouble reading the blackboard and her teacher, Mr. Scary, thinks she may need glasses. Throw in a friendly cafeteria lady, a kickball tournament and a "Top-Secret Personal Beeswax Journal," and first grade has never been more exciting. Featuring tremendously loveable characters and fun-filled songs, <i>Junie B. Jones</i> will capture your hearts in this family friendly show!</p>
